//! Unpacking a plugin, on the assumption that it is hostile.
//!
//! A distribution archive is a `.tar.zst`: a tar of the plugin directory's
//! contents, zstd-compressed. Zstd rather than gzip for ratio and speed with a
//! mature Rust binding; tar rather than zip because zip's Unix mode bits are
//! carried inconsistently between producers, which would mean the same archive
//! unpacking differently depending on what wrote it. See
//! [ADR-014](../../../docs/adr/ADR-014-plugin-registry-and-unpacking.md).
//!
//! Everything below is written on the assumption that whoever produced the
//! archive wants to get out of the directory it is being unpacked into. The
//! rules, each of which refuses by name rather than skipping the entry:
//!
//! An entry is a regular file or a directory, and nothing else. A symlink or a
//! hard link is refused whether or not its target looks like it stays inside —
//! `plugin.json -> ../../../etc/passwd` is obvious, but `a -> .` followed by
//! `a/b` is the same attack written in two entries, and deciding which links
//! are safe means simulating the filesystem the archive is building. Refusing
//! all of them means never having to be right about that. Device nodes and
//! FIFOs are refused because a plugin has no use for one and creating one is
//! how an unpacker becomes interesting.
//!
//! A path has no `..` in it, is not absolute, and still lands inside the
//! destination once normalised. Setuid and setgid bits are refused rather than
//! stripped: nothing in a plugin needs one, and an archive carrying one is
//! telling you something about itself worth stopping for. Files are written
//! `0644` and directories `0755` regardless of what the archive asked for,
//! because Cordial never executes anything out of a plugin directory — it runs
//! `deno run` against the entry module — so an executable bit could only ever
//! be useful to something else.
//!
//! Both the number of entries and the total *uncompressed* size are capped.
//! Zstd compresses a few gigabytes of zeroes into a few hundred bytes, so the
//! size of the thing that was downloaded says nothing at all about the size of
//! the thing being written.
//!
//! The content hash is checked **before anything is decompressed**, so a
//! tampered download never reaches the tar parser. Extraction happens into a
//! dot-prefixed staging directory that `manifest::discover` will not look at,
//! and is renamed into place only once the whole archive has been read and the
//! manifest inside it has been checked against the index entry it claimed to
//! be. A failed install leaves nothing that discovery can find.
