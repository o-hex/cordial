const USAGE: &str = "\
usage: cordial-load --lib-dir <dir> [options]

  --lib-dir <dir>   directory holding the APK's lib/<abi>/ objects
  --library <name>  object to load (default: libroblox.so)
  --apk <path>      APK to serve assets from; without it AAssetManager_open fails
  --read-asset <p>  read one asset through the AAsset API and report its size
  --check-overlays  report which overlay files match nothing in this build, then exit
  --client-settings <f>  newline-free list of flag names to pre-cache.
                    NOT the ClientSettings document — the engine loads values itself
  --flag-overrides <f>  JSON passed to nativePreloadFlagOverrides. DIAGNOSTIC
                    ONLY: that native does nothing observable despite its name,
                    tested with several document shapes. To actually set a flag,
                    use ~/.config/cordial/flags.json (see CONTRIBUTING.md)
  --gl-probe        bring up GLES2 through the symbol table and read a pixel back
  --window <secs>   GL PROBE ONLY: open a window and draw a gradient for <secs>.
                    This is Cordial's own test pattern, not Roblox rendering.
  --profile <name>  which profile's storage, flags and plugin grants to run
                    against; the one named default when this is not given.
                    One client at a time per profile, held by a lock for the
                    life of the process (ADR-012); a second is refused rather
                    than allowed to write over the first one's Roblox storage
  --headless        run inside a nested `cage` compositor, so no window appears
                    on this session and nothing takes focus. For agents and CI.
                    Re-execs, because the compositor has to be the parent. Fails
                    rather than falling back to a visible window if cage is
                    missing. Pair with CORDIAL_DEV_CONTROL=1 or nothing can see
                    the client at all
  --host-libc       also resolve libc from the host (ABI-unsafe; diagnostic only)
  --jni-onload      stand up a JavaVM and call JNI_OnLoad
  --game-activity   implies --jni-onload; bring Roblox up and hand it a surface
  --join-url <url>  a roblox-player:// or roblox:// link from a browser click,
                    handed to the engine during bring-up. Rejected unless it is
                    one of those two schemes, printable ASCII, and under 2 kB.
                    A roblox-player: link in the desktop launcher's format is
                    rewritten into the roblox:// form this engine matches; its
                    one-time gameinfo ticket is dropped and never printed
  --run <secs>      how long to let Roblox run after handover (default 15).
                    0 means no timer: run until the window is closed or the
                    process is sent SIGTERM/SIGINT. Closing the window ends the
                    process either way — the timer is a backstop for headless
                    and scripted runs, not the way a session is meant to end
  --dump-classes <f>  implies --jni-onload; write the Java classes Roblox asked
                    for to <f> — the observed Phase 2 backlog
  -v, --verbose     list every symbol and how it resolved

                                     traces the engine's own request, so a

  CORDIAL_NO_DRAG_LOCK=1             capture only when the engine asks, not

  CORDIAL_NO_CLOSE_EXIT=1            closing the window does not end the

                                     pattern matches. The control for the
                                     translation; the engine does not act on the

  CORDIAL_NO_VULKAN=1                make the host look like it has no Vulkan
                                     loader, forcing the GLES2/EGL fallback

                                     immediate, uncapped, fifo, fifo-relaxed.
                                     'uncapped' means MAILBOX if the driver has
                                     it and IMMEDIATE otherwise. FIFO is the
                                     only mode the spec guarantees, so anything
                                     the driver does not advertise falls back to
                                     what the engine asked for. A plugin can ask

///
/// **Why this is not a third `secrets::Kind`.** `secrets.rs` is this project's
/// settled answer for where a per-profile secret goes -- the desktop Secret
/// Service first, an announced `0600` file second, never a reason startup
/// fails -- and the right move would have been to add a variant and call it.
/// Two things stopped that. First, the task this module was written under
/// left `secrets.rs` off limits to edit, on the reasoning that a file several
/// agents have been relying on as a fixed reference should not move under
/// them mid-session. Second, and the reason a variant would not have been
/// enough even without that restriction: `Kind::load`/`save` hold exactly one
/// document per profile, and what this interface asks for is an arbitrary
/// number of small values keyed by an account id *and* a name the engine
/// picks — `getSecureValue`, `setSecureValueForUser`, `deleteUserValues`, all
/// of them shaped around a key that is not fixed at compile time the way
/// `"cookies"` and `"identity"` are. So this reuses `secrets::active()` --
/// the same environment variable, the same keyring-vs-file-vs-none decision,
/// decided once and shared with the cookie jar and the identity mirror rather
/// than asked a second time -- and carries its own small read/write/remove
/// against the same `org.freedesktop.secrets` interface under its own schema,
/// because that half of `secrets.rs` is `HashMap<String,String>`-shaped for
/// one document and cannot be reused as-is for many.
///
/// **The same restraint on printing.** Nothing below prints a stored value or
/// a user id at any verbosity, matching `secrets.rs`'s own header and
/// AGENTS.md's rule that this project's stubs answer honestly rather than
/// pretending. Key *names* are printed, the same way `secrets.rs` prints
/// `"cookies"`/`"identity"` -- they identify which field failed, not whose
/// account or what the field held.
///
/// **Why a fresh connection per call rather than `secrets.rs`'s worker
/// thread.** That thread exists because `secrets.rs` is called on a flush
/// cadence and a stuck keyring daemon must not freeze whichever thread asks
/// next. Local storage's calls are a handful of account-scoped values, not a
/// periodic save, so the simpler shape here — connect, ask, time out, drop
/// the connection — is enough: a wedged daemon leaks one thread for the one
/// call that hit it rather than jamming every later call behind a single
/// stuck worker the way a shared thread would.
