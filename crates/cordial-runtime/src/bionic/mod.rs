//! Symbols Cordial implements itself, because neither a host library nor a stub
//! is right.
//!
//! Three kinds live here:
//!
//! * **bionic-only entry points** with a host equivalent under a different name
//!   (`__errno` is glibc's `__errno_location`).
//! * **FORTIFY wrappers** (`__strlen_chk` and friends). bionic compiles these in
//!   at `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE`; each is its unchecked counterpart plus a bound the
//!   caller already knows. Forwarding loses the check, not the behaviour.
//! * **diagnostics that must not silently succeed.** `__assert2` is the one that
//!   matters: as a stub returning 0, a failed assertion inside Roblox continues
//!   with corrupt state and fails somewhere unrelated later. That is exactly the
//!   phantom-state debugging the estimation guidance warns about.
//!
//! Everything here is deliberately small. The real bionic surface is a shim's
//! job; see docs/base-evaluation.md §4.
