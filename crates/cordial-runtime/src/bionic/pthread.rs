//! bionic's pthread surface, answered here rather than by a host library or a
//! stub.
//!
//! Two opposite reasons to be in this file. A type whose layout differs between
//! the libcs is *wrapped*: the bionic-sized object becomes a handle and the real
//! glibc object lives on the heap behind it. A type that is laid out the same is
//! *forwarded* straight to the host — those entry points are here only because
//! the alternative was a generated stub, and for `pthread_once` and
//! thread-specific data a stub is fatal.
//!
//! Sizes in bytes, measured rather than read off. One probe translation unit
//! declaring `char sz_x[sizeof(x)];` per type, compiled twice and the symbol
//! sizes read back with `nm -S`: once against this tree's
//! `third_party/mcpelauncher-linker/bionic/libc/include` at
//! `-target x86_64-linux-android -D__ANDROID_API__=33`, once against the host's
//! glibc (2.43 when this was written).
//!
//! | type                  | bionic | glibc | |
//! |-----------------------|-------:|------:|-|
//! | `pthread_mutex_t`     |     40 |    40 | passthrough |
//! | `pthread_rwlock_t`    |     56 |    56 | passthrough |
//! | `pthread_attr_t`      |     56 |    56 | passthrough — layouts differ, but Roblox only ever hands the struct back to us |
//! | `pthread_once_t`      |      4 |     4 | forwarded |
//! | `pthread_key_t`       |      4 |     4 | forwarded |
//! | `pthread_cond_t`      |     48 |    48 | wrapped, on a size that was wrong — see below |
//! | **`sem_t`**           | **16** |**32** | **wrapped** |
//!
//! `sem_t` is a real mismatch: glibc's `sem_init` writes 32 bytes into a
//! 16-byte object, so the 16 bytes after it belong to whatever was adjacent.
//! The wrapper is what stops that.
//!
//! **The `pthread_cond_t` row used to read 32 against 48, and it was wrong.**
//! 32 bytes is `pthread_barrier_t`, which is `int64_t __private[4]`;
//! `pthread_cond_t` is `int32_t __private[12]`, a few declarations further down
//! the same header, and comes to 48 on LP64 — the same as glibc's. The commit
//! that introduced this module recorded the overrun as one of three ABI
//! divergences found, and the measurement above says there was no overrun to
//! find. The wrapper stays for now: it is harmless either way, since it only
//! ever writes the first 16 bytes of the caller's object, and taking it out
//! changes what runs at every `pthread_cond_wait` in the engine — a behaviour
//! change that wants its own measurement rather than a free ride on this one.
//!
//! Initialisation of a wrapper is lazy because bionic's
//! `PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER` is all zeroes, so a statically-initialised
//! condition variable can reach `wait` without `init` ever being called.
