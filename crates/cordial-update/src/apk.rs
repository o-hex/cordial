//! Getting something out of an APK, on the assumption that it is hostile.
//!
//! ADR-015: "[ADR-014](../../../docs/adr/ADR-014-plugin-registry-and-unpacking.md)'s
//! extraction rules apply here in full and were written for exactly this shape
//! of problem — an APK is a zip, and every refusal in that list is about zips."
//! So this is `cordial_plugins::unpack`'s list, applied to a zip, and every one
//! of them refuses by name rather than skipping the entry: an extractor that
//! silently steps over what it did not like produces a directory that is subtly
//! not what was published, and whoever debugs it has nothing to go on.
//!
//! ## Where a zip differs from a tar, and what that costs
//!
//! ADR-014 chose `.tar.zst` for plugins partly *because* zip carries Unix mode
//! bits in an extension field that producers populate inconsistently. That was
//! a reason not to pick zip; it is not an escape from checking, because the APK
//! format is not ours to choose. Two consequences, both stated here rather than
//! discovered later:
//!
//! **An entry with no Unix mode at all is treated as a regular file.** There is
//! nothing else it can be treated as, and refusing every mode-less entry would
//! refuse most APKs — many zip producers write no Unix attributes whatsoever.
//! What is refused is an entry whose mode *does* say it is something other than
//! a file or a directory.
//!
//! **Zip has no hard links.** ADR-014 refuses them in a tar; there is no field
//! here that could express one, so there is nothing to check and this says so
//! rather than carrying a refusal that can never fire and looks like coverage.
//!
//! ## What Cordial actually takes out of an APK
//!
//! Exactly one entry: `lib/x86_64/libroblox.so`. It is written to a fixed path
//! Cordial chose, so nothing the archive says about *where* an entry goes is
//! ever acted on — which is precisely why the path refusals below are still
//! applied to the whole archive rather than to the one entry. They are how a
//! hostile APK is noticed at all. An archive built to escape somebody's
//! extractor is not an archive to take one file out of and shrug about the rest.
